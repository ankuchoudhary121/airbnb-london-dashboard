"The initial data preprocessing was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, where the raw Airbnb listings data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. This included handling missing values, formatting variables, and selecting relevant features. After preprocessing, the cleaned dataset was saved as listings_clean_2.csv.

This cleaned file was then used as the input data for the Streamlit application. The file was placed in the appropriate directory and loaded by the app.py script located in the streamlit_app folder. The dashboard was launched by running the Streamlit application from the terminal, which opens an interactive web interface where all visualizations and filters can be explored."

The dashboard allows users to filter listings by neighbourhood, room type, and price range, making it easy to compare different segments of the market. Key summary metrics such as total number of listings, average price, and average review score provide a quick overview of the dataset.

Several visualizations are included to support deeper analysis. These include a price distribution plot to examine the spread and skewness of listing prices, as well as additional graphs that show how prices and availability vary across neighbourhoods and room types. Together, these visualizations help identify trends, outliers, and differences within the London Airbnb market.

Overall, the project demonstrates how interactive data visualization can be used to gain insights from large datasets and communicate results in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
